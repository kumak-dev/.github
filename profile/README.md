## Welcome to Cyklon 

What started as a learning exercise to get our hands dirty, has ever since evolved into a serious passion project.

It's a small twister with big ambitions 🌪️

## Features

Cyklon is a ( or will be ) full stack multi-device social app for exploring user-created events filtered by location, date and categories. 😅

that can be solved using technology and try to solve it." - Kumak
