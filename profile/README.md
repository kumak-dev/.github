## kumak.dev 

Hello there, and welcome. I'm Kumak, and this is my pond.
Feel free to look around, and do not hesitate to ping me in any case.

### About
It is an attempt to create a "My Perfect Development Environment."

A collection of libraries, workflows, generators, utilities, and services configured in a monorepo ready to generate a new project, preconfigure it, deploy on GitHub and hosting and be prepared to roll in no time. üöÄ

### Overview

**TL: DR This exercise is a part of my studies. The company is fictional but solves real problems.**

kumak.dev is a fictional organization that used a test case for <link> course I have just spontaneously enrolled in.

One of the requirements is to apply acquired knowledge to real-world examples of organizations or companies. I want to take a bit different approach. I will create a fictional 
a company called "kumak.dev", that will have an authentic purpose, goals, problems, metrics, budget, ambitions, and out-of-control lunatic CEO posting silly Tweets without consulting them with PR *

*Style Convention: Although I will try to be genuine in my approach to methodology and engineering, please don't expect me to keep 100% business vocabulary and a severe tone. I will solve the problems seriously but communicate them informally. Expect emojis, dank memes, and a wacky sense of humor

Thanks for reading,

Kumak üê∏
